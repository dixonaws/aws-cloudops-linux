The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and
configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts. During this
module, we'll use the CLI from a Linux instance in EC2 (so that you do not have to install it on your desktop). The CLI
is pre-installed when you launch an Amazon Linux instance.
