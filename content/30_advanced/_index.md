# Advanced Linux

In the advanced Linux module, you'll launch an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance into a region of AWS
and learn some basic automation techniques with the AWS CLI and bash -- skills you will need in your day-to-day
as an AWS CloudOps Engineer.<p>&nbsp;<p>

Specifically, you will do the following:
1. Access the S3 and EC2 services using the AWS CLI
2. Learn how the CLI authenticates calls by attaching an Instance Profile
3. Use the EC2 metadata service in a bash script
4. Put it all together by launching a new instance with the CLI and using EC2 userdata
