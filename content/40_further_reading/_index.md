#### Ideas to learn more about Linux and EC2
We've collected links to resources to help you round out your understanding of running Linux on AWS. 
- Try the [AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/) - a barebones Linux instance that you can access 
  from the AWS console. Can you use it to login to the EC2 instance you created in this session?
  
- Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and try to run through the steps in this workshop using only
  the command line.
    
- One of the first things to try would be to automate steps 1-6 using 
an AWS tool called [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
  
- Dive deep on [Storage Management](/further_reading/storage_management.html) in Linux to prepare for the
upcoming session on Storage in AWS.

- Dive deep on [User Management in Linux](/further_reading/user_management.html)
- Looking for more of a challenge? Dig in to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and Git
using the links below. Many companies on the cutting edge are adopting CI/CD as a means to develop
  quality software.
  
- Check out some of the HOWTOs on the 
  [Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/howtos.html), particularly [this one](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html), a great explanation of the boot sequence of a Linux machine.
