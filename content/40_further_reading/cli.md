You can accomplish all of the tasks in this workshop using the CLI, or Command Line Interface.
As an aspiring CloudOps admin, it would be a good idea to be familiar with the CLI.

Install and configure the CLI [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). 

See if you can perform these tasks with the CLI:

1. Launch an EC2 instance
2. Configure the security group
3. Create an EBS volume
4. Attach the volume to an EC2 instance
5. Delete the EBS volume
6. Terminate the EC2 instance
