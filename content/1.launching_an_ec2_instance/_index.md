### Exercise 1

# Launching an EC2 Instance
In this tutorial, you'll launch an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance into a region of AWS.
For this tutorial, we'll use the region named _us-east-1_ - this region is located in Northern Virginia, and was
the first AWS region to be constructed. 

First, familiarize yourself with the AWS Global Infrastructure. This topic will be explained in greater detail
later on in the course, but the basics are described on the next page.
