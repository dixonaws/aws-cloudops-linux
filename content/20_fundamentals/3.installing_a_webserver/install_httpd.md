In this section, we'll use the yum package manager to install a popular open-source web server, _Apache httpd_. Start connecting to the EC2 instance that you created earlier

Get the latest bug fixes and security updates by updating the software on your EC2 instance. To do this, use the following command:
{{%notice note%}}
sudo is Superuser Do - this command allows normal users to run commands as root (the superuser). Installing software is 
one common task for the superuser (usually). Learn more about sudo [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo).

```commandline
sudo yum update
```

After the updates complete, install the httpd software using the yum install command:

```commandline
sudo yum install -y httpd
```

Start the web server with this command:

```commandline
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

Configure the web server to start with each system boot using the chkconfig command:

```commandline
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

From your Linux instance, you should be able to browse to your web server. You can use a text-based browser called
lynx to browse to sites on the command line. 

Install it with this command:
```commandline
sudo yum install -y lynx
```


Now issue this command to browse to your web server:

```
lynx http://localhost
```

{{%notice note%}} 
You will initially see an error in the browser that
reads _HTTP 301 - Forbidden_. This is the default response for new 
installations of Apache httpd. Don't worry - this is expected and will show the Apache
test page after a few seconds. When you add some web content in the next section, this
error will not be shown.

Once you see this screen, you have successfully installed _Apache httpd_ and been able to browse to it from 
your Linux instance. Done!
