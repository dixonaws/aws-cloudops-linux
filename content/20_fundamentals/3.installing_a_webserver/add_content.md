By default, Apache httpd stores web content in the /var/www directory. To 
allow the _ec2-user_ user to manage files 
in the default root directory for your Apache web 
server, modify the ownership and permissions of the /var/www directory. In this 
tutorial, you add a group named _www_ to your EC2 instance and add the _ec2-user_
user as a member of that group. Then you give that 
group ownership of the /var/www directory and add write permissions for the 
group. Any 
members of that group can then add, delete, and modify files for the web server.

To set file permissions for the Apache web server, add the www group to your EC2 instance 
with the following command.

```commandline
sudo groupadd www
```

Add the ec2-user user to the www group:

```commandline
sudo usermod -a -G www ec2-user
```

Log out by issuing the <code>exit</code> command to refresh your permissions and include the new www group.

Log back in again and verify that the www group exists with the <code>groups</code> command. Your output looks similar to the following:

![groups](/images/groups_output.png?height=300&border=1&bordercolor=black)

Change the group ownership of the /var/www directory and its contents to the www group.
```commandline
sudo chgrp -R www /var/www
```

Change the directory permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories to add group write permissions and set the group ID on subdirectories created in the future.
```commandline
sudo chmod 2775 /var/www
find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} +
```

Recursively change the permissions for files in the /var/www directory and its subdirectories to add group write permissions.
```commandline
find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} +
```



Right now you are in the /home directory. You can verify this by using the "pwd" command. Change your directory to /var/www/html:
```commandline
cd /var/www/html
```

Add some sample content to be served by your web server. Add a file called index.html using this command:


```commandline
nano index.html
```

You can add any html file you want. For example, you can use this simple html file:

```code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello World!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello World!</p>
    </body>
</html>

```

Save your file and use lynx to browse to the page with <code>lynx http://localhost</code>. You should
see something like this:

![sample webpage](/images/my_first_webpage.png?height=300)



In the next section, we'll configure  the network so that you can 
access your web server from the internet.
