You should also verify billing information in the billing console to ensure that
you are not liable for any charges.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate) to activate
your user for the billing console.

Click the username link at the top of the AWS Console and then click *My Billing Dashboard*

You should see your current month-to-date balance as some amount less than $1, and your forecasted spend less
than $10.
