The EBS volume is attached to the EC2 instance. However, you need to make the volume available to use by formatting and mounting it. There
are three steps here:

1. Format the volume with <code>mkfs</code>
2. Create a mount point
3. Mount the volume

First, connect to the EC2 instance that you created earlier as you did in the _Logging in_ section.

Check the available disk devices with the <code>lsblk</code> command to ensure that you have attached the volume to your instance.

It will return something similar to:

```
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   8G  0 disk 
└─xvda1 202:1    0   8G  0 part /
xvdf    202:80   0  10G  0 disk 
```

The root device is _/dev/xvda_. The EBS volume that we just created and attached 
 _/dev/xvdf_. 

The attached volume is empty and you must create a file system on it before you can mount and use it. Issue the following command:

```commandline
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
```

You can also use the <code>lsblk</code> command to list the filesystems on a disk. Issue the following command: <code>lsblk -fs</code>. You 
should see some output similar to the screenshot below. If *xvdf* is listed with the *xfs* filesystem, then you have correctly formatted the volume.

The next step is to create a mount point directory for the volume. This mount 
point is where we will read and write files to the volume:

```commandline
sudo mkdir /data
```

{{%expand "Verification steps" %}}
List the directory to make sure you created it in the right place. Issue the following command to list the directory: <code>ls -lah /</code>.
You will see a listing of the root directory or filesystem. FYI, "/" is known as the root filesystem, not to be confused with the *root* user.
Make sure that the *data* directory exists here, indicated in the screenshot above by the entry circled in red. This entry indicates that the
*data* is a directory owned by the root user (and root group) that was created on 19 Feb at 11:52 UTC. The string _drwxr-xr-x indicates that 
the directory is read-write-execute for the owner, read-execute for the group (root) and read-execute for everyone else. These permissions
can be encoded as _755_ where the first number (7) corresponds to the owner's permissions, the second (5) corresponds to the group permissions, and the third (5)
corresponds to permissions for everyone else. Read permissions are represeted by the number 4, write permissions by the number 2, and execute permissions 
by the number 1. So, permissions of 7 are equal to read-write-execute (4+2+1). For directories, execute means that a user can enter the directory 
and list contents.

Finally, we mount the volume at the directory:
```commandline
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
```

To verify that the volume is mounted, you can use the _mount_ command
without any arguments. The last line in this sample output shows that the device
named _xvdf_ is mounted on the _data_ directory.

```

You could also use the _df_ command to list the currently mounted filesystems (df is the _disk free_ command, and the -h option is for _human readable_):

```commandline
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-60-29 ~]$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs        482M     0  482M   0% /dev

/dev/xvdf        10G   43M   10G   1% /data
```

At this point, we have created a new EBS volume, formatted it, and mounted it in the Linux instance.
There is one more step to complete to configure the system to mount the new volume at boot time. Proceed to 
the next section to configure the filesystem table.
