# Logging in

Now that you've deployed your EC2 instance, you can log in to it like any other Linux host. 
The procedure varies based on the client OS you are using (Windows or macOS/Linux). Establish a connection and have
a look around in your new instance.

{{%notice note%}}
If you stopped your EC2 instance previously, please make sure to start it first.  If your instance is not started, you won't be able to log in to your instance.

To start a stopped instance, select the instance by clicking on the checkbox next to instance name, and choose Instance state drop down, Start instance.
It can take a few minutes for the instance to enter the running state.

You can also see the instructions on how to start a stopped instance [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html#starting-stopping-instances)
