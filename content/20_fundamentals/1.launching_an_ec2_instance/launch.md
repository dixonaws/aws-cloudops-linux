Follow Step 1: Launch an instance using [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html). 
Use the following parameters:

Parameter | Value
--- | ---
Region | _us-east-1_
Amazon Machine Image | _Amazon Linux 2 AMI, SSD Volume Type, 64-bit (x86)_
Instance type | _t2.micro (free tier eligible)_
Instance Details | (accept all defaults)
Storage | (accept default 8GB SSD volume)
Tags | _Key=Name, Value=your last name_
Security Group | _SSH, Source=My IP_ 
Key Pair | Create a new key pair and name it: your_last_name-us-east-1.pem (download to desktop)

At this point, you are well on your way to becoming an AWS Cloud Operations Administrator!
