It is helpful to have some background on the AWS Global Infrastructure before we launch a Linux instance in AWS.

As of March 2022, AWS has 26 regions in its [global infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).
Each of these regions contains at least two Availability Zones. You can think of an Availability Zone as a collection
of one or more physical datacenters. There are 84 Availability Zones throughout the world. 

We'll be using the _us-east-1_ region in this session. Physically, this region is located in northern Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C.
