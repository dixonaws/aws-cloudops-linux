### Welcome Students!

# Amazon CloudOps Linux Workshop

In this workshop, we will walk through the fundamentals of Linux server administration as a part of the AWS Cloud Operations course.
By the end of this four-session module, you will be able to perform basic Linux and AWS administration tasks as a preparation for the
following AWS Cloud Administrator bootcamp. Depending on your level of experience, you may want to have a look at the [Further Reading](/further_reading.html)
section to learn more about Linux administration.<p>&nbsp;<p>
<br>
We'll have four instructor-led sessions in this module. You should expect to get through the basics - Exercises 1 and 2 - 
during the first session. Exercises 3, 4, and 5 are a bit more challenging. Work through them and 
bring questions during the instructor-led sessions. Feel free to get in touch with you mentor if you want to
walk through any of the exercises in more detail.
